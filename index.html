    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise the client to go through the necessary check for potential security risks. Checking for XSS attacks, SQL injection and other security risks by testing and checking the HTML. Also making sure the information on the page is secure and that only authorized users can access that information.
        The website would be advised to be hosted on a secure platform that would help with the security of the website. Hosting on for instance Netlify gives access to security, Https, constant updates and more. 
        Getting a HTTPS certificate is also important as it shows users that the information being sent and received by the website is encrypted and secure.
